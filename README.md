# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Domagoj and I am currently studying computing at [**Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing**](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/). I am from Sinj but I currently live in Zagreb.

I have acquired technical knowledge and skills from my course as well as practical knowledge by being part of student association BEST Zagreb.
